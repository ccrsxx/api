# API

My personal API for my projects and services. This API is built with Node.js and Express.js, and it serves as a backend for various features that I use across my projects.

## Features

Currently, the features include:

- Open Graph Image Generation: Generates Open Graph images for my projects.

## REST API

Coming soon.
